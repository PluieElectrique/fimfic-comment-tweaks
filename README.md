## Legal

This userscript is under the MIT License. A copy can be found in the `LICENSE` file.

Some of the code has been directly cribbed (copy and pasted, variables renamed) from the Fimfiction source code. When possible, the script wraps existing code. When this is not possible (e.g. a new, large feature must be added on top of an existing one), code must be copied.

The code in question is `Copyright (c) 2011-2018 knighty & Xaquseg`. It is not provided under an open-source license, thus, this is copyright infringement. Hopefully, though, the amount copied is small enough that they don't mind.
